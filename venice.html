		Venice is a young woman that must return to the namesake Los Angeles neighbourhood in order to take care of her dying grandfather, Henry.
		After Henry's death, Venice will grief his loss through a scavenger hunt in which she must find her grandfathers' five most beloved records.
		With every finding, she will reminisce about the conversations during Henry's final days as they tried to rekindle their relationship.
		Despite dialogue being the main way to get to know both characters, environmental clues found while completing the scavenger hunt can also help to understand them.
		The game touches on themes of acceptance, change, family and social justice, among others.

		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Gameplay & Sound Design:</b><br>
		As most Twine games, the player is allowed to make choices and shape their own adventure.
		Even though the game is quite linear, the choices made during dialogue will uncover different aspects of Henry and Venice's past together.
		The player also engages in the scavenger hunt, which allows them to explore the neighbourhood of Venice as they complete different puzzles and minigames.
		Ambience sounds help immerse the player into the story and bring the texts on screen to life.
		</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>UI & UX Design:</b><br>
		The game is divided into the five stages of grief, each one represented by a distinctive colour that is also present in some UI elements. 
		This change makes the interface in every chapter feel unique and in tune with the narrative.
		Apart from text and ambience sounds, some illustrations are included to enhance the story on a visual level.</div></li>
