		<ul>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Writer & Narrative Designer:</b><br>
		After a terrible car accident, a man is stranded in an abandoned forest with little hope to get out. 
		Thanks to environmental storytelling, a letter and the main character's thoughts, the player soon discovers that the forest is actually inhabited by someone else.
		Visual clues, such as a destroyed camp and a skull next to it, indicate that this other person might not be so friendly after all.
		The player then must look at every nook and cranny of the forest to find their way out before it's too late, resulting in two possible endings for the game.</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Gameplay & Economy Designer:</b><br>
		The gameplay is mainly centred around exploration and survival mechanics. 
		The player can move around the map on foot and also by riding a quad. They can also hunt, cook, collect food, materials and craft items to survive in the forest.
		Every item that can be crafted requires a specific combination and amount of materials or, in some cases, having crafted another item previously.
		All the while, the player must watch over their health, hunger and energy, each one of these stats being dependent on the others. 
		</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Level & Sound Designer:</b><br>
		The vast forest is divided by a river in three parts, each one of them with different interest and reference points, such as a watchtower, a cabin or a cave.
		The world is filled with basic platforming obstacles and different types of flora and fauna, including rabbits and deer, which will run away from the player;
		however, there are also wolves, which will attack and hunt the player down.
		Immersion into the forest is achieved thanks to a variety of spatial and environmental sounds that also change from day to night.</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>3D Artist & Programmer:</b><br>
		Apart from the design, I was also responsible for 3D modeling and animating wolves and rabbits, as well as other elements such as trees, bushes and apples.
		I implemented some of the game mechanics via Unreal's Blueprint Visual Scripting as well. 
		I was responsible for the animals's behaviour, the quad's movement and other minor world interactions.</div></li>
