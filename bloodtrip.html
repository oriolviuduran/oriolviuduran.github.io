		<ul>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Gameplay & Economy Designer:</b><br>
		The game is divided in several fun and dynamic minigames, one for each organ that can be visited.
		Difficulty is adaptable so as to make the game accessible to children with different levels of gaming experience. 
		Therefore, each minigame gives the child more or less assistance depending on their performance and ability.
		The player has three different stats: energy, lives and cells. In the end, the child is given a mark based on their performance and final amount of each stat.</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Writer & Narrative Designer:</b><br>
		In order to make the game more engaging for children, there is a backing story about how they have to complete a day in their life.
		To do so, they must aid the protagonists (three blood cells) in going to every organ to ensure they are working properly.
		For instance, if the next task is to stay focused in class, the minigame will be based on the brain.
		The intention is to complement a more traditional method of teaching with gamification and a relatable story.</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>UI & UX Designer:</b><br>
		The interface for the game is intended to appeal to children with bright colours, short texts and very visual explanations.
		Everything is explained and shown as simply as possible in order to ease the comprehension of the game mechanics.
		There is an accessibility option for children with dyslexia, as the font can be changed to make the texts easier to read. 
		The game can be played either in English or Catalan.</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Programmer:</b><br>
		Apart from the design, I was also responsible for scripting and implementing all game mechanics and general game behaviour,
		including the adaptable difficulty system and accessibility options.</div></li>
