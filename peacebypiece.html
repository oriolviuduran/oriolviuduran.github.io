		<ul>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Game & Narrative Designer</b><br>
		The premise of the game is simple; place twenty objects or tiles of different colours and try to achieve the highest score possible.
		However, once all objects have been placed, it is revealed that the player was in fact placing buildings and organising their own city.
		Each colour of building is a representation of a different social class, and placing buildings of the same colour within each other's range gives a higher amount of points.
		The intention behind keeping the player in the dark about the true meaning of the game is to misguide them into sorting the buildings by colour,
		making them realise how unconsciously people normalise classism, segregation, and racialised urban planning.
		Once the game ends, the player is also able to read through the stories of the residents of each building.
		</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Sound Designer & Programmer</b><br>
		The tonal shift once the truth is revealed is also displayed via sound, as it goes from abstract and cosy, to realistic and gritty.
		Due to time constraints, we were not able to implement a better UI and point system to properly display the consequences of where you place each object,
		making the message of the game not be as resounding as we would have liked.</div></li>

			<div class="text">Entry for the <a style = "color: #ffd63e" href="https://itch.io/jam/fair-play-jam/rate/3020402" target="_blank">Fair Play Jam 2024</a>, 
			held at Campus Gotland of Uppsala University and centred around anti-racism, inclusivity, and respect through play. 
			The main theme chosen - from six possible ones - was "Small changes are big changes", 
			as the very small action of choosing "where to place a tile" brings much bigger repercussions.</div>
