		<i>Cook, Don't Tell!</i> is a five-player party board game set in an extremely loud restaurant.
		For every round, each player gets assigned a different role; waiter, drinks, appetizers, main dishes, or desserts.
		<br><br>
		When a round starts, a client card - which contains a hint for what they may or may not want - is drawn.
		Two "restriction" cards, which include the client's allergies or dislikes, are then drawn and only seen by the waiter.
		Afterwards, the waiter has to draw on their notepad these restrictions and show them to the other players without saying a word - as the restaurant is too loud and communication is impossible.
		The other four players then must choose between their three options at hand to give the client something they might enjoy.
		When the time is up, all players must reveal their cards at once. The waiter then checks for possible conflicts between the dishes chosen and the client's preferences.
		Depending on whether the requirements have been met or not, the restaurant's star rating is updated, and either a positive or negative card is shown.
		After every round, roles are passed around and new cards are picked.
		The game ends when the restaurant's rating reaches either zero or ten stars.
		<br><br>
		It was created with five other teammates for the course <b>Introduction to Games Research</b>, 
		from the Master of Arts (MA) in Game Design at Uppsala Universitet - Campus Gotland.
		The given assignment consisted in designing a board game where players have to reveal their choices at the same time.
