		<ul>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Writer & Narrative Designer</b><br>
		Grady Belle is an old estate on the Louisiana bayou long believed to be haunted.
		Home to wild alligators, and tales of voodoo and jazzy vampires, people always avoid approaching her. When they do, her attempts at greeting them is what drives them away - 
		and for that reason, the house is feeling rather lonely.
		However, everything changes when an outcast kid named Bella grows fond of the house, as they realise they are not much different after all.
		The story itself is structured into a twenty-eight page rhyming children's book and is based on interactive storytelling.
		</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Game & Level Designer</b><br>
		Each scene - or page in the book - requires a specific set of interactions with certain objects; these include clicking, dragging and dropping, or a combination of both.
		Although mechanically simple, the game still feels engaging thanks to its story, charming visuals, and immersive audio design.</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Sound & UX Designer</b><br>
		Almost 50 different sounds were used, with most being edited, cut, mixed, and layered in order to achieve the desired immersion. 
		A jazzy looping track is played throughout the game, together with background sounds that change depending on where the scenes take place.
		Each interactable object has a unique sound effect that is played when it is clicked on or dragged to the correct position. 
		Once a scene is completed and the button to go to the next scene shows up, a “ding” is played through the right audio channel in order to indicate the player where to look.
		Other elements such as visuals, animations, or a "playable" main menu, were used in order to further the user experience.<div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Programmer</b><br>
		I was also responsible for implementing the game mechanics, game feel, in-engine animations, and sound mixing.</div></li>

			<div class="text"> Developed for the course <b>Game Design Studio</b>,
			from the Master of Arts (MA) in Game Design at Uppsala Universitet - Campus Gotland. 
			The given challenge was to "design a game that occurs in a haunted house". 
			Our proposal aimed to defy with convention by personifying the house itself and telling the story from its own perspective.</div>
