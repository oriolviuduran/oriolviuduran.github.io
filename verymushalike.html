		<ul>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Writer & Narrative Designer:</b><br>
		The logline for the game is: "At nightfall, three lonely mushrooms must join forces to reach the top of a mountain."
		This required cooperation between the characters, each one with their own abilities and personal troubles, 
		is the representation of the main themes of teamwork, diversity and uniqueness. 
		The dusky forest backdrop displays the disorientation of the characters and their desire to hide from others,
		whereas the fall and autumn setting is a representation of leaving things behind, as well as of a new beginning.</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Gameplay & Level Designer:</b><br>
		Since the main theme of the game is "cooperation", the gameplay revolves around all three characters using their own special abilities to help the others.
		Levels and puzzles are intended to be balanced and make every character as useful as the rest without taking into account their size or athleticism.
		In conclusion, the three mushrooms are designed to be unique and self-sufficient, but also reliant on their teammates.</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Programmer:</b><br>
		Our principal programmer had to quit the jam due to scheduling problems, so I couldn't take as much time with the design as I would've liked to. 
		Nonetheless, I was glad to put my scripting skills to the test by implementing everything related with enemies, obstacles, checkpoints and respawning.</div></li>
