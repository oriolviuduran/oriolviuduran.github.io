		<div class="subtitle">Role & Responsibilities</div>
		<ul>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Writer & Narrative Designer</b><br>
		After a terrible car accident, a man is stranded in an abandoned forest with little hope to get out. 
		With environmental storytelling, a letter, and the main character's inner thoughts, the player soon discovers that the forest is actually inhabited by someone else.
		Visual clues, such as a destroyed camp and a skull next to it, indicate that this other person might not be so friendly after all.
		The player then must look at every nook and cranny of the forest to find their way out before it's too late, resulting in two possible endings for the game.</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Game & Economy Designer</b><br>
		The gameplay is mainly centred around exploration and survival mechanics. 
		The player can move around the map on foot and also by riding a quad. They can also hunt, cook, collect food and materials, and craft items to survive in the wilderness.
		Every item that can be crafted requires a specific combination and amount of materials or, in some cases, having crafted another item previously.
		All the while, the player must watch over their health, hunger and energy; each one of these stats being dependent on the others. 
		</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>Level & Sound Designer</b><br>
		The vast forest is divided by a river in three parts, each one with their own interest points, such as a watchtower, a cabin, or a cave.
		The world is filled with basic platforming obstacles, and different types of flora and fauna. Animals such as rabbits or deer will run away from the player,
		whereas wolves will attempt to attack and hunt the player down.
		Immersion is achieved thanks to a variety of spatial and environmental sounds, which also vary depending on the time of day.</div></li>
		<br>
		<li><div class="text"><b>3D Artist & Programmer</b><br>
		Apart from the design, I was also responsible for 3D modelling and animating the wolves and rabbits, as well as other minor elements such as trees, bushes, and apples.
		I also implemented using Blueprints some of the main game mechanics, including the animals' behaviour, the quad's movement, and other world interactions.</div></li>
