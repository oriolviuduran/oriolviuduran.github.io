		<i>WindBugs 98</i> is a two-player luck-based race board game.
		One of the players is assigned the role of the developer, while the other is the tester, and both of them play using a D12 die.
		<br><br>
		The goal of the developer is reaching the green flag in the end while navigating through bugs and files placed on the board.
		On the other side of the board, the tester is trying to sabotage the developer by "bluescreening" them, and placing the files and bugs strategically.
		Files might make the developer advance or regress a certain amount of tiles, while bugs will oblige them to stop until they can remove it.
		In addition, a "recycling bin" tile will make the developer move back to the start tile.
		If the playtester rolls a 12 at any round, they "bluescreen" the developer, who will then have three chances to roll either a 1 or a 12 to keep playing.
		<br><br>
		It was created with four other teammates as an entry for the <b>Pen & Paper Jam 2024</b>, a four hour board game jam organised by VisSpel - 
		the section board under the Student Union Rindi for the Game Design students at Uppsala Universitet - Campus Gotland.
		The theme for the jam was "It's a feature, not a bug", and our project was voted as the winner for the
